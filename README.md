# challenge-1
In this challenge, I made the following changes to the index.html file in order 
to improve the semantic structure.
I replaced the divs with semantic HTML elements like section.
I also improved the visual structure by aligning the paragraphs. 
Overall, these changes help improve the semantic structure and accessibility of the HTML code, making it easier for search engine optimization.
